   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>There are a billion ways to make a pasta sauce, but this is my favorite so far.  It takes a long damn time and has to be made in these particular steps to fully develop the "depth of flavor".  I've broken down the steps into various "Phases" so that you can divide the labor if you have helpers.   You will need a Dutch Oven or similar sized pot.  Makes 8 ample servings</p>
