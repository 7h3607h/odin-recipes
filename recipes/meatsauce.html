   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>There are a billion ways to make a pasta sauce, but this is my favorite so far.  It takes a long damn time and has to be made in these particular steps to fully develop the "depth of flavor".  I've broken down the steps into various "Phases" so that you can divide the labor if you have helpers.   You will need a Dutch Oven or similar sized pot.  Makes 8 ample servings</p>
   <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <p><ul><li>1 Lb Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 LB Ground Pork</li>
        <li>1 LB Italian Sausages (sweet, mild or spicy your choice)</li>
        <li>2 Large Carrots</li>
        <li>4 Stalks of Celery</li>
        <li>1 Whole Onion (Red onion preferred, but any work)</li>
        <li>1 Whole Bell Pepper (Red, Yellow or Green)</li>
        <li>1 Whole Zucchini or Squash or both even</li>
        <li>8oz of Mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 Whole Bulb of Garlic</li>
        <li>8 Whole Tomatoes (or 2 cans of whole, peeled, or diced tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 big can of traditional pasta sauce, OR 2 small cans/jars </li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>4 Cups or Stock or Broth (Beef, Chicken, Bone or Vegetable whatever you have)</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Wine (again anything works if not too sweet or too dry)</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Worchestersire Sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Balsalmic Vinnegar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of Brown Sugar</li>

        <li>2oz Fresh or grated Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>1 LB of Dry Pasta</li>
        <li>A few splashes of Olive Oil</li></ul></p>
